<h2>Step 3: Data Download</h2>
<p>In this step, vehicle data is downloaded for each provided VIN number.</p>
<p>Please run very large batches outside of normal business hours (6AM - 6PM Eastern time)</p>
<p><b>Please note that downloaded data may not be in the exact same order as the source data, although this program makes a best-effort attempt to order the results to match the order of the original VIN numbers provided.</b></p>
<p><b>Please make no assumptions about the completeness of this data, since it is downloaded from the Internet - particularly if you plan to merge data into an existing spreadsheet.</b></p>
<p>You may press the Cancel button at the top of the page next to the progress bar if you need to stop the download process.</p>
<p>If this computer's Internet connection is lost, the program will wait indefinitely for the connection to return.</p>
<p>Once the download is complete, you will have two options to obtain the result data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy All To Clipboard</li>
<li>Save</li>
</ul>
<p>"Copy All To Clipboard" copies all of the data shown on this page so that you can paste the data into the spreadsheet program of your choice. This option does not allow you to pick and choose which columns you want. If you choose this option and the data has successfully been copied, you may exit this application by clicking Cancel at the bottom of the page or the X at the top-right corner of the window.</p>
<b>Data copied from the clipboard is tab-delimited so that it can be recognized as CSV data when pasted into a spreadsheet program</b>
<p>"Save" allows you to narrow down column selection quickly and easily prior to saving the data in .xlsx format. Most newer spreadsheet programs can read data saved in this format.</p>
