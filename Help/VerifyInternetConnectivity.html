<h2>Verify Internet Connectivity</h2>
<p>Under normal circumstances, you should not see this page. There are three main reasons why you may see it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The application is unable to access the Internet</li>
<li>The application is unable to obtain results from the NHTSA web service</li>
<li>You clicked the Previous button from the "Step 3: Data Download" page</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two different error messages that you might see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please verify Internet connectivity and click Try Again</li>
<li>Please verify configuration settings and click Try Again</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first error, "verify Internet connectivity", the application is unable to access the Internet in general. If you are unaware of what may be causing this error, your organization's IT personnel may be able to assist with this problem. Once your computer has Internet access, click the Try Again button. You can also try to run this application from another computer if the error persists.</p>
<p>With the second error, "verify configuration settings", the application is able to access the Internet but not specifically the NHTSA online database. Generally, you or your organization's IT personnel can submit an Issue on the github page for this project and this program's author(s) will be notified to fix the problem. Advanced users can access the configuration settings by clicking on the Configuration expander to attempt a workaround. Explaining the configuration settings is beyond the scope of this help document.</p>
